# Environmental Variable

1. create a file at the root of the project
```
.env
```

2. Inside the .env file add the text:
- you must use `NEXT_PUBLIC` or else it will not work.
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TITLE = "Digital Design and Development"
```

3. On the age, in between the export and return write the variable: 
```
var title = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TITLE
```

4. Then in between the manu write:
```
{title}
```

5. Make sure the `.gitignore` file has the `.env` inside 
- you want to prevent this secret title to be shown
